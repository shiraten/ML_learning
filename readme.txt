This repo is a simple exercice I did to help me being sure I understand ML basics

It is a very basic linear regression ML algorithm, using only array

The goal was to apply maths formula myself directly, without using numpy or any ML libraries. To ensure I understood all parameters used in ML basics and how they interact with each other
